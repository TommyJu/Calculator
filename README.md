# Calculator
Introduction: The goal of this project is to create a working calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS we will have a web application with a dynamic graphical user interface.

Summary: This was such a fun project! I really enjoyed the challenge of creating the logic for my calculator and then turning this logic into a practical and useful application. 

I'm confident that whenever I feel overwhelmed or don't know where to start, I can break things down into smaller pieces and use problem solving to my advantage, after taking time to understand the problem fully of course.

By observing how the calculator app on my laptop works, I broke down the calculator logic into a series of cases and replicated its behaviour. However, I realize that my program would have been a lot simplier if I didn't focus so much on how a calculator is "supposed to behave". For the next project I will think more about how I would want this app to behave if I were the one using it. I'll also name my variables better instead of "a, operator, b" for instance.
